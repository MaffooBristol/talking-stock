The Talking Stock
=================

A live stock ticker that says out commands to you, as long as you have "say" installed. I'll work towards a better solution soon.

- It's using a should-have-been-long-deprecated Google Finance endpoint. It may stop working one day.
- A lot of traffic from one IP will make Goog's captcha kick in, so best not make it send too many reqs/min.
- This is just me playing really, the code ain't the greatest.
